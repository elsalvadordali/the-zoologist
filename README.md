# Project 1 - The Zoologist

Submitted by: Tijana Jung

The Zoologist is an app that shows you fun facts about various animals you might encounter at the zoo 

Time spent: 20+ hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are able to see a customized app icon and launch screen
- [ ] Your app should work for any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints
  - [ ] Mark here if you will demostrate auto layout implemention as horizontal rotation or different phone size or both, then erase this text
- [X] Users are able to see at least 3 context items
- [X] Users are able to tap into each context item and see detail view contains information about each item (title, description, picture if applicable, etc.)
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring
- [X] Allow users to scroll when context items are off-screen (table view implemention)

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Layout created entirely programmatically
- [X] Spent 5 days of my life implementing a UITable
- [ ] I want to add more animals and details.. but I ran out of time

## Notes

Considering that I am working in an unfamiliar language (swift), using an unfamiliar framework (UIKit), and a largely unfamiliar except in theory paradigm (OOP), I'm happy with how it looks in a mobile vertical way. I could 
   not yet figure out how to make UIScrollView scroll when the phone was rotated, unfortunately, but man did I try. I learned that it's considered bad practice to have a TableView inside a ScrollView, but I'm still not really sure why. Also, I added an icon, but it disappears after a second when you close out of the app.
